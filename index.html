In terms of my career, I want to always improve my abilities and understanding of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Learning several programming languages, such Python, Java, and JavaScript, as well as going deeper into computer science principles like data structures and algorithms, should be the top priorities. In addition, I want to contribute to open-source projects so that I may work with developers all around the world, broaden my experience, and give back to the community. <br>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm Guano T. Ramos, and I'm a University of Mindanao Tagum College student starting an exciting path of self-discovery and development. I have always been amazed with the mysteries of the world, and my never-ending curiosity has driven me to pursue knowledge and comprehension.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy the challenges that a wide range of courses provide in the classroom. Regardless of the subject matter solving historical challenges, examining mathematical complexity, or exploring about programming,I approach every class with an eagerness to learn. Instead of just learning information by heart, I try to fully understand the underlying ideas and how they apply to real-world situations.

                         The dress shop activity is similar to our e-commerce project in that it requires extensive learning of PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This was our most recent lab exam in May.

                    Compared to the other companies we have used in the past, Thrive has been far and above the best in every area. While building our new web site, the customer service has been prompt and straightforward and the actual services are well documented and logical to our needs. We are very excited to be working with Guano. Over just a short period of time I can tell that we are going to be doing business with Guano for a long time and will gladly recommend them to anyone… except our competition.

                    Guano listened to everything we needed and wanted in a new website, then delivered it! Our new website is fun, exciting and easy to use for me and our audiences. I have gone through website redesigns before, and by far, this one was the easiest and least painful. I was listened to and respected through every step. We couldn’t be happier with our new website.
